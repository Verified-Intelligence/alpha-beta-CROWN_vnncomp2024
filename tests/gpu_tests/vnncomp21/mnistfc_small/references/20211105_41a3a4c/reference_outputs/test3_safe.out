/home/shiqi/miniconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/onnx/mapping.py:27: DeprecationWarning: `np.object` is a deprecated alias for the builtin `object`. To silence this warning, use `object` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. 
Deprecated in NumPy 1.20; for more details and guidance: https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations

/home/shiqi/miniconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/onnx2pytorch/convert/layer.py:25: UserWarning: The given NumPy array is not writeable, and PyTorch does not support non-writeable tensors. This means you can write to the underlying (supposedly non-writeable) NumPy array using the tensor. You may want to copy the array to protect its data or make it writeable before converting it to a tensor. This type of warning will be suppressed for the rest of this program. (Triggered internally at  /opt/conda/conda-bld/pytorch_1616554793803/work/torch/csrc/utils/tensor_numpy.cpp:143.)
